IDEA: Hamiltonian cycle


Quantum solution:

Constraint language in math ? No more imperative thinking !!!
Defining constraints is same as solving the problem itself !!!

Define constraints:
* node must have exactly 2 neighbors ( in and out)
* connect by horse moves, possible neighbors are limited
* All nodes must be connected
* Input: 64 nodes, put in superstate
* Convert constraints into a circuit, 
    * how to represent neighbors in circuit
    * how to make on/off neighbors
